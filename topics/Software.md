## SVG Software

> Most applications listed here are available for PCs running Intel CPUs, some also as Apps for Android/ChromeOS and iOS/iPadOS, or as Cloud Apps.

### My Personal Preference

For designing simple infographics and symbols for the web, I use a combined workflow of Libreoffice and Inkscape.
  
* [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) - Powerful, but limited for working conveniently with text
* [Libreoffice Draw](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/draw/) and Libreoffice Impress can export SVGs if done right

### More Free and Open Source Software, [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)

* [Animatron](http://www.animatron.com)
* [Boxy SVG](https://boxy-svg.com/main.html) - basic
* [Inkpad](https://github.com/sprang/Inkpad)
* [CleverBrush](https://www.cleverbrush.com)

> Some of the free tools might have In-App purchases or paid versions. Similarly, the commercial versions of the tools are might have a free tier available, or a trial period.

### Commercial Software - available as subscription or purchase

* [Adobe Illustrator](http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html)
* [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/)
* [Autodesk Graphic](https://graphic.com/)
* [Concepts](http://concepts.tophatch.com)

* [iDraw](http://www.indeeo.com/idraw/)
* [Sketch](https://sketch.com)
* [Webcode](http://www.webcodeapp.com/)

> The commercial software is optimized for handling big, complex SVG graphics, for various application domains, such as engineering, architecture, and design.
