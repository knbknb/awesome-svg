## SVG Software

> Most applications listed here are available for PCs running Intel CPUs, some also as Apps for Android/ChromeOS and iOS/iPadOS, or as Cloud Apps.

### My Personal Preference

For designing simple infographics and symbols for the web, I use a combined workflow of Libreoffice and Inkscape.
  
* [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) - Free, Powerful, Ongoing in 2022. but sometimes limited, e.g. when working with text, inconvenient to use.
* [Libreoffice Draw](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/draw/) and Libreoffice Impress can export SVGs if done right

### More Free and Open Source Software, [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)
> See also [Optimizing, Fallbacks and Tools](https://github.com/knbknb/awesome-svg/blob/updates-2022/topics/Optimization-tools.md) page.

* [Boxy SVG](https://boxy-svg.com/main.html) - basic
* [Inkpad](https://github.com/sprang/Inkpad) - FOSS for the iPad, 2.6. stars, but abandoned since ~6 years. 2.6 stars
* [SVGEdit](https://svg-edit.github.io/svgedit/) - Online Vector Editor
* [Animatron](http://www.animatron.com) - for creating Videos(?). Not really SVG-focused.

> Some of the free tools might have In-App purchases or paid versions. Similarly, the commercial versions of the tools are might have a free tier available, or a trial period.

### Commercial Software - available as subscription or purchase

* [Adobe Illustrator](http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html)
* [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/)
* [Autodesk Graphic](https://graphic.com/)
* [CleverBrush](https://www.cleverbrush.com) - Online Vector Editor, free to use
* [Concepts](http://concepts.tophatch.com) - Mobile App
* [Gravit Designer](https://www.designer.io/en/)
* [iDraw](http://www.indeeo.com/idraw/)
* [Sketch](https://sketch.com)
* [Webcode](http://www.webcodeapp.com/)

> The commercial software is well-suited for handling big, complex SVG graphics, in various application domains, such as engineering, architecture, and design.
