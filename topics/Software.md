## SVG Software

> Most applications listed here are available for Intel PCs. Find also some Apps for Android/ChromeOS and iOS/iPadOS, or Software-as-a-Service Apps, Cloud Apps.

### My Personal Preference

For designing simple infographics and symbols for the web, I use a combined workflow of Libreoffice and Inkscape.
  
* [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) - Free, Powerful. Ongoing development in 2022. Has some limitations, e.g. inconvenient to use when formatting text-objects.
* [Libreoffice Draw](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/draw/) and Libreoffice Impress are better with text-objects, and can export good SVG code, if done right.
* [Exporting SVG](https://www.sitepoint.com/designers-guide-working-with-svg/) - More info about SVG-Editor oddities, by Alex Walker, 2014
### More Free and Open Source Software, [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)
> See also [Optimizing, Fallbacks and Tools](https://github.com/knbknb/awesome-svg/blob/updates-2022/topics/Optimization-tools.md) page.

* [D2](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2) - A modern diagram scripting language that turns text to diagrams. 8.9k stars
* [SVGBob-Editor](https://ivanceras.github.io/svgbob-editor/) - convert ASCII-Art into SVG. 3.2k Stars on Github
* [Boxy SVG](https://boxy-svg.com/main.html) - basic editor for SVG. Desktop-App for Linux and MacOS. For web designers and web developers. Generates clean SVG code by default.
* [Inkpad](https://github.com/sprang/Inkpad) - FOSS for the iPad, but abandoned since ~6 years. 2.6k stars
* [SVGEdit](https://svg-edit.github.io/svgedit/) - Online Vector Editor
* [Reanimate](https://github.com/reanimate/reanimate) - library for programmatically generating animations with a twist towards mathematics / 2D vector drawings, based on Haskell, inspired by 3Blue1Browsn's Python Library *manim*. 1k stars (in Dec 2022)
* [Animatron](http://www.animatron.com) - for creating Videos(?). Not really SVG-focused.
* [ssspill](https://fffuel.co/ssspill/) - In-Browser SVG generator for a stylistic spill/melted effect, (patterns + shapes)

> Some of the free tools might have In-App purchases or paid versions. Similarly, the commercial versions of the tools are might have a free tier available, or a trial period.

### Commercial Software - available as subscription or purchase

> Sometimes, with a free tier.

* [Adobe Illustrator](http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html)
* [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/)
* [Autodesk Graphic](https://graphic.com/)
* [CleverBrush](https://www.cleverbrush.com) - Online Vector Editor, free to use
* [Concepts](http://concepts.tophatch.com) - Mobile App
* [Figma](https://www.figma.com) - In-Browser Editor, can export Layers as SVG
* [Gravit Designer](https://www.designer.io/en/)
* [Sketch](https://sketch.com)

> The commercial software is well-suited for handling big, complex SVG graphics, in various application domains, such as engineering, architecture, and design.
